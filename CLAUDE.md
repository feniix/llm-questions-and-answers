# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a discussion and documentation space for infrastructure design questions and ideas. No code implementation is required - focus is on conceptual exploration, architecture discussions, and design thinking.

## Repository Structure

Each infrastructure question/topic should be organized in its own directory:

```text
/question-XXX-topic-name/
  README.md          # Main discussion and analysis
  diagrams/          # Architecture diagrams, flowcharts
  notes/             # Additional notes and thoughts
```

Use sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.) to maintain chronological order while keeping topics separate.

## Content Guidelines

- Focus on infrastructure design concepts and patterns
- Include architectural diagrams where helpful
- Document thought processes and decision rationale
- No code implementation needed - this is a thinking/planning space
